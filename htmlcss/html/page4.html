        <h2> The political consequences of the internet</h2>
   <p>
    The Internet has grown into a ubiquitous infrastructure that societies all over the world 
    are increasingly reliant on. To which extent and how does the internet have political consequences? 
     
   </p>
<br>
   <p>
    Every day we use different infrastructures, such as electricity, the water system, and the internet. 
    Infrastructure shapes society, as it limits what is accessible to us. This also means that it has 
    political implications. The internet is an infrastructure where different social platforms can be 
    used and created, where people can communicate with others easily and get information quickly to 
    impower and support different ideas. 
</p>
<br>
   <p>

    An example can be the Black Lives Matter movement that began in 2013 but became more popular in 
    2019-20 with the death of George Floyd. This incident can be seen as a breaking point that sparked a 
    bigger and stronger movement against police brutality and racism. Different social media platforms 
    caused the movement to spread rapidly and globally. The movement became so popular, that even people 
    from a homogeneous country like Japan were inspired to follow the movement and tackle their own racial 
    problem in their country. In addition, the followers of the movement played an important role in Biden’s 
    presidential campaign and shifted the power from the Republican to the Democratic party. 
</p>
<br>
   <p>
    However, the use of social media is not only positive. It has become easier to raise awareness, 
    but it has also become easier to spread “fake news”. Research done by PEW research center shows 
    that 72% believe that technology has made it easier to manipulate people with false information and 
    rumours. This can be seen in political campaigns as well, all the “fake news” scandals that happened 
    during the 2016 US elections had a big impact on the voters and their choice. 
    With these examples can we see how the internet can be used as a powerful tool, to cause both 
    positive and negative political consequences.

<left><h2>The societal responsibility of innovators</h2></left>
    <p>
    The statement, “The person who invented the train invented the train crash”, says a lot 
    about the negative consequences of science we can see today. Whether its intentional or not, 
    science and technology has caused a lot of negative impacts on our society. Simple inventions 
    like social media were created to make communication between friends easier, but instead it has 
    caused a lot of “train crashes” like snapchat dysmorphia, teen depression and higher suicide rates. 
    Therefore, its very important to put more societal responsibility on innovators to prevent these 
    negative impacts from happening. 
</p>
<br>
   <p>

    According to a video by senior advisor Anders Braarud Hansen at OsloMet , 
    the way to more responsible choices, are by thinking of ethical and future impacts. 
    Is the innovation safe for the public, can it do harm, how will it improve the future etc. 
    Science and the government also have to cooperate more with the public, so that we all can share 
    responsibility on making sure everything’s going the right way. That’s something the new RRI’ 
    (Responsible, Research and Innovation) guidelines for researchers and scientists are for, to prevent 
    future mishaps like these to happen again. 
</p>
<br>
   <p>
    If responsible choices had been more important in the past, we could’ve stopped global warming from 
    getting to this point. It would’ve been more focus on sustainable development, by getting more 
    environmentally friendly energy rather than using diesel/oil, and then we could’ve saved the worlds 
    chaos from coming to this point. By thinking of it like this, we can truly see which impacts our 
    innovations can have and try to stop them in time instead of looking back in regret.
