    <h1>Accessibility in center</h1>
<br>
<div class="p-introduction"> 
    Web accessibility is very important as it makes the content on a website more 
    user-friendly and easier to understand for all visitors, 
    especially those with disabilities and limitations. We have therefore had this as our focus while creating the page. 
</div>

        <div class="flex-container">
            <div>
        <h2> Color Contrast </h2>
        <p>
         We have kept our page simple, by using colors like black and white. 
        The orange color that we have assigned to our nav bar, is inspired by the Oslomet webpage.
          We wanted to create a sense of connection between this first-year “blog” and the official 
          university website. We have also used this to highlight our nav bar, making it easier to access 
         and more convenient for the user. 
         </p>
         <p>
         We decided to use a light background with dark text to make the information stand out and be 
         easy to read. The contrast we have has a ratio of 17.76:1, which is way past the standard 
         contrast ratio of 4.5:1 that all websites should have
            <img src="../images/stats.jpg"
             width="350"
             height="100"
             title="Color pair contrast testing by a11y"
             style="float:left";>
        </p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            
            <left><h2> Navigation Bar </h2></left>
            <img src="../images/stats2.jpg"
             width="350"
             height="100"
             title="Color pair contrast testing by a11y"
             style="float:left";>
        <p> Another thing that we have put effort into is page structure content. 
        We have very clearly labeled the different regions of the page on the navbar, in a 
        logical and efficient way. “Home” “reflection essay” “Accessibility” and “Topical information” 
        and “fun page” are our five regions, and each region has a very clear heading. We have done this 
        to improve the navigation and orientation of the web page. We have furthermore also made the regions 
        change the background color and text color when you hover over them with a mouse. 
        This had been done to make it easier for the visitor to find the information it needs.
        </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <right><h2> Scroll to the top </h2></right>
        <p>
        We have also created a “scroll to the top” button. This returns you to the top of 
        the page when you have scrolled all the way down. The user can get back to the point of 
        where they started, and also back to our five regions; 
        if they wish to find some other information
        </p>
        <br>
            <right><h2> Tabindex </h2></right>
    
        <p>
            Tabindex is a global attribute that allows HTML elements to receive 
            focus. This is also something we have used to make the information on 
            our page more accessible. This makes it easier to browse the page as 
            you can navigate to a different element by pressing on the “tab” key on 
            your keyboard. When using this it is very important to keep in mind to have a 
            logical navigation flow. We have therefore started with the navigation bar, 
            it will flow through all of the regions before scrolling down on the page. 
            This is also why we have made a lot of subheadings within our texts, 
            so it will be easier to navigate with the tab key, but also because it 
            makes the information easier to find. The main reason why we used the tabindex,
            was to make the site more user-friendly for people that are visually impaired.
